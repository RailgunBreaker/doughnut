# Doughnut
This open-source repo is a template for students who took ANU ASIA2067 Asian Economy and would like to draw the doughnut figure by themselves.
## Ackowledgement 
The doughnut figure was created by me using Python; however, I would like to appreciate ChatGPT and Yipeng (Perry) Zhu from the Department of Computer Science, University of British Columbia, to debug and shape the code.
## Something Beforehand
The variables are counted from `0-1.0`, representing a percentage of the country's variable situation, so you need to convert your data into percentages before using the template. An example here is North Korea.

`ecological_ceiling` can exceed `1`, and the "over" section will become red, representing the exceeding session in the doughnut figure.
